Late 2019, I saw a twitter thread regarding the protests happening in Hong Kong. At the time, a user was frustrated Signal didn&#x27;t warn others that if you&#x27;re using the default keyboard on an Android device, that all your message content could potentially still be logged by a keylogger depending on your device.<br/><br/>I thought even if Signal could display some sort of warning, how long would it take for that to get implemented everywhere and approved? Are quick community driven changes like this a priority for Signal? The request seemed to go unobserved until early 2021.<br/><br/>For several years, the fact that society does not have an agreed upon protocol for instant messaging has bothered many. Email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3) has worked this way for a long time. However, it&#x27;s arguable email is widely adopted today because of centralization surrounding those providers.<br/><br/>Signals creator Moxie Marlinspike has discussesed how for mass adoption,<!-- --> <a class="underline" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/26/taking-back-our-privacy">centralization of a platform and a focus on product will only help.</a> <!-- -->If you want to own your own mail server, or switch to a more trustworthy email provider, there&#x27;s a breadth of options. It&#x27;s much harder to host your own signal server and chat with those using Signal. Matrix aims to solve this problem, but seemingly falls short to realize the benefits of creating a cohesive, or product centric platform.<br/><br/>At the time, I saw countless posts on reddit where users stated they wanted to switch to Matrix but it was hard because the platform as a whole felt fragmented, encryption configuration and flows was difficult for the non-technical, and [Element&#x27;s] UX was bad.<br/><br/>I thought how useful would it be for those attempting to resist censorship if they already had agreed upon a standard messaging protocol, that had allowed them to host a secure session with relatively little work. Matrix has created easily deployable docker containers for Synapse. If a client was focused on branding and user experience as much as Signal, I bet we could drive adoption.<br/><br/><b>We need to decentralize the web</b>, but also provide a means of freedom within that system. Matrix has the potential to be a standardized peer-to-peer chat protocol,<!-- --> <a class="underline" href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p-2-p-matrix">and in a way already is</a>, that will allow people to communicate and transfer their data at will.<br/><br/>Additionally, if the goal for Matrix is adoption to make instant messaging communication go the way of email, a network effect is required for this paradigm shift.<!-- --> <br/><br/>Syphon makes the bet that the best way to attract new users is through strong branding and user experience. I hope that contributing and maintaining Syphon will help kick start this process and help those in need.<br/><br/>Since starting on this project,<!-- --> <b>the [Element] teams have started making strides at unifying their branding</b> <!-- -->and user experience. If Riot rebrands well, and focused on all the same features that Syphon originally set out to impliement, [Element] will likely be the client you should use to access Matrix for the time being. This was out of my belief that Matrix was ready, it just didn&#x27;t seem like Riot was at the time.<br/><br/>Syphon will always be a not for profit, community driven application.</p></div></div></section></div></div></section></div></div></body></html>
